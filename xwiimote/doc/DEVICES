= Nintendo Wii Devices =

  Nintendo produced many different devices for their Wii and Wii-U products.
  This file tries to list and describe all of these sorted by their model
  number. As there is no official documentation by Nintendo, there is no
  guarantee that this list is complete or correct. Feedback and contributions
  are welcome!

  This file tries to describe which devices exist and how their look differs
  from each other depending on the model number. However, this file does not
  describe any wire/wireless protocols or other software behavior.
  This file only describes the mechanics and physical views of the devices.
  See the DEV_* files for further information and communication details.

== Device Identification ==

  On each device you can always find a model number like
  "RVL-003", "WUP-005", ... These are always present and identify the type of
  device. However, there might be multiple revisions of a device that behave
  differently even though they have the same model number. Hence, you can often
  find additional numbers that identify the device revision. But these numbers
  aren't found on all devices and might be inconsistent. We haven't exactly
  figured out what all of these mean and we need much more data from people who
  own such devices.

  Therefore, please notify us if you have different devices that aren't listed
  here so we can extend this list continously.

== Device List ==

  Following a list of all devices with their respective model number and other
  device identifications. First, a list of Wii related products, then Wii U
  products. Many products work with both, Wii and Wii U, but Nintendo uses a
  different numbering scheme so we split them up here.

=== Nintendo Wii Products ===

  Wii products have model numbers starting with "RVL". It probably stands for
  "ReVoLution" which was the codename of the Wii.

  RVL-001
    Product: Wii Console
    Label: Wii
    Model: RVL-001 (EUR)
    Revision: C/RVL-EUR-1
    Color: Black
    Year: 2006
    Description:
      This is the Wii console. It exists in different colors but they seem to be
      the same hardware otherwise. It is unclear whether it was revised for
      multiple revisions or whether they differ according to the country-code.
      No differences have been discovered and it seems safe to assume that they
      are all the same.

  RVL-004
    Product: Wii Remote Nunchuck Extension
    Label: <none>
    Model: RVL-004
    Revision: <none>
    Color: White, Black
    Year: 2006
    Description:
      The Nunchuck is an extension controller for the Wii Remote. It is
      connected with a cable and features 2 buttons and a joystick.
      No country-codes are known, neither does it have a revision number. Even
      the ACN code seems to be equal between all devices so there was probably
      only one type produced and never been revised.

      LMA-RVL-WR/Z-C4  (Cyan, late revision)
    Color: White, Black, Cyan
    Year: <none>
    Description:
      Wii Remote with built-in motion plus extension. Comes in two different
      revisions. One is mostly the same as the old Wii Remote RVL-003 with a
      plugged in Motion Plus extension.
      The late revision has changed a bit. It is more strict about the protocol,
      advertises a different name and changes some other bits. It seems like it
      is a whole new revision of the Wii Remote with the Motion Plus sensor
      really built-in instead of only attached internally. It also changed the
      Bluetooth chip from Broadcom to CSR, which explains why it differs so
      much.
      Probably also comes with different bug-fixes and _may_ contain
      compatibility fixes for the Wii-U.
